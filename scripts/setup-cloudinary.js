=================================
  Cloudinary Setup for Production
=================================

Your images are currently stored locally in public/uploads, 
which won't work on Vercel. Let's set up Cloudinary (free tier).

Steps:
1. Go to https://cloudinary.com and sign up for a free account
2. Get your credentials from the Dashboard
3. Add these to your Vercel environment variables:
   - CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
   - CLOUDINARY_API_KEY  
   - CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

For now, as a quick fix, let's update your Next.js config to handle 
images differently in production.

Alternative Quick Fix:
---------------------
1. Use external image URLs (like from imgur.com or similar)
2. Update products to use those URLs
3. Or use the logo image as a placeholder for all products

Would you like me to:
A) Help set up Cloudinary integration
B) Create a script to use placeholder images
C) Set up Supabase Storage (if you already have Supabase)

For now, I'll create a quick fix...
